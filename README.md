Dwolla Oauth
============

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the [Dwolla Docs](https://www.dwolla.com/developers/)


Configuration
-------------
Make sure you have an application registered with Dwolla.  They will give you a client ID and client secret, which go at the top of the file. You will also need to change the redirect_uri to the uri you would like your user redirected to after they have approved your application for use.  Change the permissions array to include only the permissions you would like access to.

Use
---

Call the auth_url function to get the url the user needs to be sent to in order to approve the permissions.  Once they sign in on Dwolla and approve the permissions they will be redirected back to whatever you set as your redirect_uri

	$dwolla = new dwolla();
	$url = $dwolla->auth_url();


The user will be redirected to the redirect_uri page with a get parameter of "code=SOMETHING". Call the get_oauth_token function from this page passing in the value for the code GET parameter.  This will return the result from the request and set the oauth_token within the object.  

	$dwolla = new dwolla();
	$dwolla->get_oauth_token($_GET['code']);

Once you have an oauth_token you can make requests with that object.

###Examples

For example if you want to get the users balance you would make a call like this:
	
	$balance = $dwolla->balance();	

To get their contacts:

	$contacts = $dwolla->contacts();

Transactions are a bit different, to send money:

	$reciept = $dwolla->transactions("send", null, $data);

Where $data is an associative array with key/values specified by the table [Here](https://www.dwolla.com/developers/endpoints/transactions/send)



Notes
-----

The oauth_token that you request does not currently have an expiration date so presumably it could be stored and you don't have to request it more than once for any given user.

If you are creating user accounts the password needs to have 8 characters with 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase and 1 number. 

All the data that needs to be sent is passed as an associative array.
